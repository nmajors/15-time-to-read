        <p class="article--paragraph">That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? </p>
        <p class="article--paragraph">I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Computer, belay that order. This should be interesting. Then maybe
          you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. You enjoyed that. Besides, you look good in a dress. Talk about going nowhere fast. We
          could cause a diplomatic crisis. </p>
        <p class="article--paragraph">Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? How long can two people talk about nothing? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I
          would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Your head is not an artifact! You did
          exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.</p>
        <p class="article--paragraph"> Not if I weaken first. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Your shields were failing, sir. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers.
          Well, that's certainly good to know. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. We have a saboteur aboard. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as
          we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. I will obey
          your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. I can't. As much as I care
          about you, my first duty is to the ship. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Computer, lights up! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. We finished our first sensor sweep of
          the neutral zone. The unexpected is our normal routine. Sorry, Data. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! What? We're not at all alike!
          Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. I'll be sure to note
          that in my log.</p>
